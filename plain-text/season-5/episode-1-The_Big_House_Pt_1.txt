Just eating butter like a popsicle, 
huh, Boyle?

Yeah, I know, 
I'm spoiling myself,

but I'm depressed. 
Or have you forgotten

that Jake, my best friend, 
is in prison?

- Wait, Jake's in prison?
- Yeah!

He and Rosa were framed for
a bunch of bank robberies

by Lieutenant Hawkins.

Oh, right. 
And where's Gina?

On maternity leave!
 We were all at her baby shower

- last week.
- Okay.





     


And why am I bleeding?

I don't know, Hitchcock.

Oh, 
so you don't have all the answers.

I'm bleeding because my
piece-of-crap

son-in-law bit me.

Look, we all miss Jake and
Rosa,

which is why we have to
keep working the case.

There has to be some
way to exonerate them.

I've been looking, but
I can't find anything

- and I don't know what to do.
- "I can't find anything

and I don't know what to do":

- title of your sex tape.
- What is happening

- right now?!
- They caught Hawkins

trying to flee the country.





     


She confessed to everything,

- and they let me out.
- Oh, my God,

Jake, is it really you?
Are you really here?

You know it, baby.

But first... I gotta
hug my best friend.

- Yeah.
- What?

Welcome back, Peralta.

I just heard from the mayor.

To apologize for what
happened to you,

they're sending you to Disney World.

You and one male guest.

As long as I don't have to go
on any of the scary rides.

- I'd just go for the shows.
- Yeah!

Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!

Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!

Boyle!

Were you dreaming about
Jake again?

Why did you wake me up?!

I told you never to wake me up!

Oh, my God.

Guard! Guard!

- Hi, hey.
- Hi.

Oh, man, three weeks is
way too long

- between visits.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

It's been so hard to get down
to South Carolina between

work and spending every
free minute on your case.

All right,
that's enough touching.

You used all
the touching time, Amy.

I get 100% of the
goodbye touching time.

- 100%.
- So, Charles, I gotta ask:

- what's going on with your hair?
- Well, it turned white

from the stress, but I
didn't want you to worry,

so I dyed it back to my
normal color

with a splash of Batali.
Do you like it?

So, how's my case going?
Have you found anything

on Hawkins? I've been
working it in here.

You know, when no one's watching.

In my cell. At night. In the dark.

I guess I've been mostly
thinking about it.

We're tracking her 24/7.

You know, watching her men,
combing her old files,

but she's done a great job
at covering her tracks.

We will find something, babe.

I swear.
Don't give up hope, okay?

How are they treating you?
Are you safe?

Yeah,
I'm in protective custody

because everyone in gen
pop hates cops.

I'm not really sure why.
Something about us

locking them in cages

and letting the world pass them by.

So, it sounds

like you're isolated and
haven't had any chance

- to make new friends.
- Well, my cellmate,

- Caleb, is okay.
- Just remember he's in prison.

No matter how small the
crime, people don't change

and don't deserve
second chances.

Charles, relax.
I'm not gonna replace you.

Trust me,
all I've been thinking about

is when you guys are
gonna get down here.

And now you are, and
we can finally talk.

There's an incident

in the yard.
We're going into lockdown.

Uh, no, we just bumped

- Jenny, baby!

I love what prison's
doing to your figure.

Okay. So, how's prison?

Nobody likes cops in here, so
I had to earn their respect

by starting a bunch of riots.
Got thrown in solitary

for a week. What's going
on with your face?

I hate seeing you like this,
so I'm flexing my eyes

real hard to keep from crying.

It's okay, we can still
have a normal conversation.

So... how's the food?

Pay no attention to him, Rosa.
He's very emotional, Rosa.

Why are you saying my
first name?

Well, Rosa, I read an article
in a medical journal

that said one destabilizing aspect

of incarceration is the
constant dehumanization,

Rosa. You need to be reminded

that you're more than
just a number, Rosa.

You are Rosa... Rosa.

- Yup, that fixes prison.
- Is there anything we can do

to help you?
Anything you need done

- on the outside?
- No, I'm good.

- It's not a problem.
- Rosa.

- We're here for you.
- Rosa.

- Whatever you need.
- Rosa.

Okay, I'll come up with a list.

The alarm went off before
we could even talk.

Aw, that's too bad, bud.

But at least you have
people that wanna come

and visit you.
My family hasn't been

to see my since my trial.
You eat nine people

and all of the sudden they "don't know

who you are anymore."

Wait... what?

Did you say "eat people"?
Are you a cannibal, Caleb?

Well, that's not how I
would define myself.

If we're going by what I'm
most passionate about,

I would say that I'm a woodworker.

Why did you think I was
in protective custody?

I don't know, I guess I
hoped you were another cop

wrongly convicted of
crimes you didn't commit.

Nope,
I did all my stuff and more.

There's tons they can't
even trace to me.

The secret is eating the
evidence.

Okay, this is just great.
I don't see anyone

from the outside for
another three weeks

and my only friend here
is a cannibal.

Woodworker.
Look, if you really wanna

talk to people on the outside,

- just get a cell phone.
- Yeah, that'd be great,

- but it's illegal, right?
- There's this guy

in gen pop... Romero.
He can smuggle anything

into this place: phones, drugs,

- big bag of hair.
- Why would you want that?

You know what?
Don't tell me.

The less I know about you, the better.

Okay,
let's find this Romero guy.

Right now?
I really wanna chomp down

- on this meat.
- Caleb...

This is scary.

I don't like being so near gen pop.

It's fine.
It's not like they're

all waiting for an
opportunity to kill us.

I'm sure some of them
are actually nice,

like this gentle giant here.

Hello, sir, what brings
you to the fence today?

Just here to stab you
if you get too close.

Neat. Caleb, remind me

not to stand too close to
the fence.

Will do. Oh, here's Romero.

So, what's up? You need
another bag of hair?

- Yeah.
- No.

We'll talk later.
Same order, though.

I hear you're the man
to talk to

- about getting a cell phone.
- I am.

But it'll cost you.
Phone's 100.

- $100? That's no problem.
- I got no use

for cash. I want 100 soups.

- Soups?
- Yeah, ramen.

They're like a major currency in here.

Really? That is very surprising.

You can't smoke anymore,

so ramen has replaced cigarettes.

- NPR did a big thing on it.
- I thought they sold ramen

- at the prison commissary.
- I don't want commissary soups,

- you stupid little bitch boy.
- Okay, that's fair.

- I deserve that.
- I want flavors

you can only get on the outside...

Chili-lime shrimp,
southwestern chicken...

- Street flavors.
- Picante beef.

Oh, that's my favorite.

Get me picante beef,

- Then let's give it a shot!

So, Picante Beef,
I hear you wanna be

- part of my crew.
- Not ideally the nickname

I would've chosen for myself, but yes,

I think I could be of help to you.

Do you know how long I've
been in this prison?

17 years!

- Well, you look great.
- And not once,

- in all of that time, Beefy...
- It's just "Beefy" now?

top gives it an extra

Wasn't I, Tank?

Hasn't stopped talking about it.

Come here, Beef Baby!

Great. So, does this mean

- that I'm part of the crew?
- Nobody can touch you now.

Wow, guess all it took
was the ramen tip.

Actually, you gotta do
one more thing for me

- to close the deal.
- Absolutely no problem.

Actually, I have a great
idea for a ramen dessert.

- You make it with Jell-O mix.
- I need you to kill a guard.

Oh... okay. Great.

Cool-cool-cool-cool, cool-cool-cool.

Beef Baby's out for blood.

So...

Okay, this guard you
gotta kill, Wilsom...

Oh, I'd rather not know his name.

It's Alan Wilson. He's
got a three-year-old,

Dexter. They call him Dex.

Cool. I'm not worried at all

about little Dex. I'm
sure he'll be fine.

- I mean, I grew up without a dad.
- Yeah?

- Me too.
- So did I.

See? And we're all doing great.

Can I ask what this Wilson did

- to deserve this?
- He beat the crap out of me.

- How?
- More importantly, he keeps

interfering with my
business interests.

But it's about my thing too, right?

Of course.

How are you gonna do it?
Shiv him, shank him, stab him?

Are those different?

Oh, boy. Should I be asking

- someone else to do this?
- No, no, no, no.

It's fine. I'm gonna
prove myself to you.

But what if instead of killing Wilson,

we get him fired?
That way, you don't have

another man's death on
your conscience.

Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

No, of course not. Why would it?

But if we murder him,
there's gonna be

an investigation, and that
could bring a lot of heat

- down on you, you know?
- I can see that.

But that's not how we usually
do things around here.

Sure, but you know what else

you didn't used to do around here...

Sprinkle uncooked noodles
on top of your ramen.

You're right. You're right.

You've earned the benefit of the doubt.

You have 24 hours, Beef Baby.

- Beef Baby.

- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

- Jake.
- Beef. Baby!

Beef Baby.

Okay, here's the plan.

Tank said Wilson beats up inmates,

so all I have to do is
get him to attack me

and then file a complaint
with the prison board.

Sure, but whenever the
bulls attack us...

Which happens all the time...
the security cameras

are conveniently not working that day,

so it's just your word
against theirs.

Well, lucky for me,
I have my own camera.

It's the perfect plan.
Hey, I've never

been beaten up by a
prison guard before.

They don't use that baton, do they?

You seem pretty committed to this plan,

so there's no real
benefit to me answering.

Sounds good.

So, you painted my apartment?

Walls in "White Wisp,"
trim in "Honeymilk."

- And you filed my taxes.
- You're getting

- your maximum refund.
- And picked up

- my abuela at the airport?
- Yes, I went and got her

at the Philadelphia
International Airport in...

- Pennsylvania.
- And you broke the news to her

about how I got sent to prison
and she'll probably die

- before I get out?
- Mm-hmm, had that

- fun conversation.
- But it was all worth it

for you, you poor little caged bird.

Great, because I have
another favor to ask.

- Another?
- Yeah, I need you

to cancel my cable.

That's it?

That's easy.

I've been on the phone for six hours

and I just wanna cancel an account.

Yes, you've mentioned the bundles

and I don't want home phone service.

No, do not transfer me, Rodrigo...
no, no!

No, Rodrigo!

All right, there's Wilson.

I'll go make him mad.
When he attacks me,

you film it. Then afterwards,

- we'll meet up in the bathroom.
- Okay, great.

What are you gonna do to
get him angry?

Well, I don't know him,

so I'm not sure what
buttons to push,

but I'm sure if I try enough things,

something will set him off.

Excuse me,
can I ask you a question?

- Get back to your table.
- Yeah, you know, I would,

except for...

- Oh, my God, that's all it took?
- I told you

to get back to your table!

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

What hurts the most is
knowing

that prisoners are treated
this way every day

in our penal system...
also, he kicked me

- in the wiener a bunch.
- Mm.

Show me the video. I'll
send it to Charles,

he'll say he got it
anonymously, and then...

Oh, my
God, that's all it took?

Caleb, is this it? Did
you film yourself

- the whole time?
- Okay, look, I've been

in prison for 15 years. I'm not good

with new technology.

You want somebody to
lure a kid to a park

using a Lycos chatroom,
I'm your man.

Look, just press this button

and make it front-facing.
Come on, let's try it again.

Hey, Wilson...

Please tell me you were pointed

in the right direction that time.

Yes, but there was a different issue.

Caleb! You added the
fiesta filter?

- I'm doing the best I can.
- Tell that to my wiener!

- I'm doing the...
- No, don't really... gosh...

Okay,
how'd you screw it up this time?

I didn't. I got everything.

I even zoomed in for some close-ups.

Oh, thank God.

I was so sure that something
was gonna go wrong.

Hey there, Peralta.

Oh, I'll take that phone now.

I heard an inmate and a guard
were having a fight.

So I go to do what
I normally do:

- turn off the security cameras.
- Yup, cool policy.

- This place is great.
- And that's when I noticed

your cannibal pal
taping the whole fight

with an illegal cell phone.
And what were you planning

on doing with this?
Blackmailing Wilson?

No, I was trying to save his life.

- Ah, come on.
- Honestly.

I was ordered by this guy,
Romero.

- I don't know his first name.
- Jeff?

Really?
Romero's first name is Jeff?

- Yeah.
- Anyway, Jeff ordered me

to kill Wilson, but I
convinced him to let

your guy live if I got
him fired instead.

Why do you want him to lose his job?

- He's a good man with a family.
- I mean, he did stomp

- on my head a bunch of times.
- Those were warning stomps.

What are you, part of
Romero's crew now?

No, I was trying to get in.
That's what the video was for,

- but obviously, it didn't work.
- All right.

- I'll fire Wilson.
- Really?

- Why?
- Romero's responsible

for most of the illegal stuff
that goes on in this prison.

I've always wanted a man
on the inside.

Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

The only people less popular in
here than cops are snitches.

Well, let's be honest,

it's not great in here
for trans people.

- That is so true.
- I know.

- They have a hard time.
- It's a problem.

Regardless, I won't snitch, okay?

It's too dangerous.
I'll find some other way

- to stay alive.
- All right.

Good luck with that.
