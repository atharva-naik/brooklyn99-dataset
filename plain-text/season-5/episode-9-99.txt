>I'll get back to you guys

with all the logistics.

Sergeant Terrance Jeffords,

four years ago
on this exact date,

you told me I was too old
to learn how to do the worm.

I vowed on that day
to prove you a fool,

and today,
I shall.

Captain McGintley,
just passed away.

Oh, no.

We're going to Los Angeles

I'll have the travel

Hey, has anyone seen

Oh, man. Sad day.

Sad day.

It's crazy
how different things were





     


when McGintley was Captain.

It was like the Wild West.

- Oh, yeah, we had some fun.
- I didn't.

In every one of those photos,
I look uptight and worried.

Meanwhile,
everyone else looks like

they're having
the time of their life.

That's because
they're all stress-free,

not like us Type A's.

Jake, am I too high-strung?

I wouldn't say
you're too high-strung.

You just are high-strung.

You know, your strung
is what makes you strung.

- You're strung strongly.
- No, not anymore.

From now on,
I'm gonna be super chill.

So, where's the party at?

Trick question. The
party's right here, boy!

Oh, hello,
Mrs. McGintley.

My condolences for your loss.

So, who do you got
your eye on?

- What?
- You haven't dated anyone

since you broke up
with Pimento.

And funerals are
a meat market.

Sadness is a powerful
aphrodisiac.

No, it's not.

Then how come everyone cries
during sex?

I'm already seeing
somebody, Boyle.

Oh...

And just like that,
things got interesting.

And just like that, I left.

- Hello, Raymond.
- Oh, Chief Aggerton.

I didn't realize
you'd be flying out for this.

I liked McGintley.
He was fun to have a beer with.

There's nobody
in this department

I wanna have a beer
with anymore.

Yes, that's the problem
with the NYPD.

So, I hear
you're meeting with

the Commissioner
on Monday morning.

Well, you didn't
hear this from me,

but... Commissioner's
retiring next year.

They put a short list together
of possible replacements,

and you're on it.

- This is your first interview.
- Really?

- What?
- Oh, my God.

- What's going on?
- What's going on is

Captain Holt has an interview
to become the Commissioner

of the freakin' NYPD,

and he's gonna nail it
and fulfill his destiny

as Lord High Commander
of all Justice.

Okay, let's not get
carried away.

Who says I'm even interested
in becoming Commissioner?

You, constantly, including
the first day I met you.

I'm interested in
becoming Commissioner.

- Good to know.
- Fair enough, but even so,

it's probably a long shot.

I mean, there are
many names on the list.

Nope, just four.

Yeah, three major league jags
and you.

Sir, you're the perfect candidate:

smart, well-respected,
you smell great.

That has nothing to do
with the job.

It's just something I've
been meaning to tell you.

- Is it sandalwood?
- Please calm down.

Right, totally.
Don't wanna jinx it.

I don't believe in jinxes.

Great, then you won't
mind me saying it's a lock.

You're definitely gonna get it,
and you're gonna smell even better

with that Lord High Commander
of all Justice stank on you.

Let's do this

I can't wait to get on a plane.

I used up my miles,
and upgraded first class.

- Damn, Sarge.
- This is gonna be great.

snacking on a hummus trio,

watching "Bridget Jones's Baby."

- Oh, GPS says turn left here.
- Turn left.

No, this route is more direct.

Oh, okay. You do you,
Commish.

- Please don't call me that.
- Okay, fine,

I'll just call you the 'Mish...
no wait, Mishy Elliot...

no wait,
Mish-es Doubtfire.

Oh, my God!

- What? What is it?
- Nakatomi Plaza.

It's the most important
monument in all of America.

The building from "Die

Can we pay our respects?

Ooh, our flight leaves in
three and a half hours, and...

but it's like,

- Can we go in, sir?
- Fine, just make it quick.

Yes! Pull in over there,

What?

That's the name of the driver
in the movie.

We're going to Nakatomi Plaza.
There's gonna be role-play.

Oh, my God.

It's even more beautiful

It's an empty floor

Okay, all 600 of these are great.

- We should probably head to the airport.
- We have more time, if you need it.

There's literally nothing
left for me to shoot.

All right, let's get out of here.

The door is locked.

That's strange, I thought
the guard propped it open.

I'd kick my way out, but I think
these windows are bullet-proof.

We're not getting
any reception in here.

Guys, it's cool.
We just gotta roll with it.

- You know, travel should be like jazz.
- Nuh-uh.

There's a lie-flat seat
waiting for me,

and I wanna be napping in it,

with a hot towel wrapped
around my big bald head!

- Help!
- All right,

everybody just calm down.

I'm sure that guard will be
back in, like, five minutes.

We're gonna miss our flight.

I should be sitting next to
a semi-famous person

that I can't quite place
right now.

Come on, don't give up.
If we get rescued right now

and there's no traffic
at the airport

and the van return goes smoothly

and Security's super chill
about all the guns we have,

we could still make it.

- You guys okay up here?
- Yes! See?

I told you not to give
up hope. It's a miracle.

- We're still gonna make it!
- Yeah, we missed our flight by a lot.

Yeah, but that's okay.
We can get the next one.

Let's see, next flight...
Cancelled. Cancelled.

- Cancelled. What is going on?
- There are huge storms in the Midwest.

- All flights are grounded.
- Oh, man.

I know this is the wrong
time to bring it up,

but we're standing
75 feet from where Argyle

picked up John McClane
at the airport.

- Take my picture with it.
- Yeah.

Okay, we can't get out until
Monday afternoon, at the earliest.

I tried everything. I begged.
I pleaded. I even told them

that Scully was a Make-a-Wish kid
with a rare disease

that makes him
look like a giant old baby.

- Did you call it Scullyosis?
- Damn it, Rosa,

that's really good and
completely useless to me now.

They wouldn't even let me
into a first class lounge,

since my flight had already departed.

I grabbed this and ran.

You're all that's left of
my dreams now, Mr. Mint.

All right, stop hugging your mint.
We have bigger problems.

Captain Holt's Commissioners
interview is on Monday.

- Can't he just reschedule?
- No!

He's gonna be up against
the best of the best.

The slightest slipup could
cost him the job, and...

but whatever, you know.

It is what it is, Daddy-O.

Look, Captain Holt
helped us all achieve

our collective dream of
going to Nakatomi Plaza.

- Only you.
- Now it's time for us

to return the favor and
help him achieve his.

Get him back to New York
in time for that interview.

Now, we have until Monday
morning, and it takes...

48 hours to drive
from L.A. to New York.

- We've still got time.
- No, we don't.

I checked with all the
car rental agencies.

There are no available vehicles.

I'm just gonna have to call the
Commissioner, cancel this meeting.

No, not on my watch.

We just have to think.
There's gotta be a way to get you back.

Got it! May I present
to you the finest RV

The American Creeper.

No one should have to
suffer like this for me.

This is a dream come true.

It's a cross-country road trip.

No. Over the course of my career,

best not to have hopes.

Nine-Nine!

Nine-Nine!

Not a doctor.
