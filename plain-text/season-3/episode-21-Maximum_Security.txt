- Ka-blamo, scrubs.

I nailed it.

I solved Captain Holt's
brain teaser

and found the location
of our secret meeting.

The answer?
The broom closet.

In your face.

- In whose face now?
- Yours.

- Gina and I have been here
20 minutes.

- Though my presence
is not puzzle-related.





     


I just followed Terry
into a dark closet.

- Hey.

You solved the puzzle
before me.

Nerds.

- [scoffs]
They solved it first.

They're the nerds.
I'm cool like you.

- Wait. Where's Captain Holt?
Where's Amy?

- Yeah, she should be
the first one here.

Doesn't she go to, like, an
adult puzzle camp every summer?

- Yes, but please don't
bring that up.

I've been throwing out
her mailers.

- Guys, if those two
aren't here,

I'm thinking we must be
in the wrong place.

- No, trust me, we're
definitely in the right place.





     


I'm 100% sure about this.

- Well, guess who
solved the puzzle?

- Who?
- We did.

- Oh, we did?

- Yeah, we're
in the wrong place.

[upbeat music]

♪ ♪

- Thank you for all
finally showing up.

Let's recap.
As you know,

Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis
put out a hit on Adrian Pimento,

which the mob believes
succeeded.

For his safety
Pimento has gone off the grid.

- Remember, the only people
we can trust

with this information
are in this room.

- And Genevieve.
We can trust Genevieve.

We share a life.
I tell her everything.

- Fine, the people in this room,
and Genevieve.

- Genevieve's mom also knows,
but she's in a coma,

dead any second,
we're good.

- Okay.

- Unfortunately, we can't just
arrest Figgis,

because he has a man
inside the FBI.

- The good news is,

we have a lead that's gonna
break this case wide open:

Maura Figgis,
Jimmy's sister.

She's currently serving

in a maximum security prison
in Texas.

- A white woman in prison,
in Texas?

[scoffs]
She must be bad.

- She murdered three people,

and she knows
Figgis's operation,

so we're sending a detective in
undercover as an inmate

to get close to her.

- Yeah, and guys,

this isn't one of those
women's prisons

that we've all seen
being all sexy

on late-night cable.

You know, with the ladies
touching each other's bits,

and there's kind of
some lame jazz playing.

When these chicks fight,
it's for real.

So be mature.

- Peralta is gross,
but correct.

- Mm.

- This facility
is a violent place

filled with
hardened criminals

We need to send someone
who can blend in.

- Sir, I would be honored

to take on
this challenging assignment.

[laughter]

Why is everyone laughing?

I can be a badass.

- You're raising
your hand right now.

- We're in a meeting.

- I just assumed Diaz
would be the prisoner.

Nothing personal,
it's just, you know...

she's terrifying.

- Thank you, Sir.
- Mm-hmm.

Dismissed.

- Hey, that was crazy, right?
I mean, I can be scary.

- Oh, yeah.
I watch "Jeopardy" with you

and you're a straight-up
psycho.

- Aww.
Thanks, babe.

- I'll take "Awesome
Girlfriends" for 500, Alex.

- I know you're being sweet,
but don't disparage "Jeopardy."

- Okay.

[classical music playing]

- All right, listen up.
- [groans]

You're not gonna try to
convince us

Mahler was the original
punk rocker again, are you?

- No, the music is a classic
counter-espionage maneuver.

I don't want
to be overheard.

But, since you mention it,

Mahler was one
in-your-face bad boy.

- Right, um, so,
what's going on, sir?

- Oh, I have a plan

to draw out Figgis's
man in the FBI:

Throw a funeral
for Pimento.

Now, before we,
quote, unquote,

bury Pimento,

we need to, quote, unquote,
open an investigation,

find a, quote, unquote,
corpse,

and obtain a, quote, unquote,
death certificate.

- Kind of feel like
you could have just used

"air quotes."

- I can also wear short pants
and drink for a jug

that says "XXX."

- Fake funeral's
a good idea, sir,

but where are we gonna find
a corpse?

- We don't need one.

We just need pictures
for the case file.

- If I may,

imagine Pimento's
dirty, pale body

being pulled
out of a manhole

after a couple days'
sewer bloat.

- Mm.
- Now squint your eyes...

and look at Hitchcock.

- Oh, yes.

I believe
we've found our corpse.

- You positively glow.

How do you feel?
- Great.

I could smother somebody
in their sleep with this thing.

Pregnancy's dope.

- Whoa, bup, bup, bup.

That big old womb
is not a weapon, okay?

It's just an excuse
to talk to your doctors,

AKA, Charles and me,
in private.

If you need to chat,
just schedule an appointment

with Brent Kennedy,
ob-gyn.

- And I'm Glen Kennedy,
ob-gyn.

We're twins, like
"Property Brothers,"

but for gynecology.

- No, I said no to that idea.
- [sighs]

- You are Isaac Schwartz,
my older Jewish mentor,

and you are
Isabel Cortez.

You're in for
stabbing a man on the subway

46 times
in the trachea.

- Tight.

- The pregnancy stuff
is my area of expertise.

Since Genevieve started
fertility treatments,

it's all we talk about.

Now... show me your waddle.

- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay, okay.

[with Cockney accent]
Nice.

- Good work.

You really
look like a corpse.

- And I'm not even
wearing makeup.

[camera clicks]

- Time of death: 8:26 p.m.

Now all I have to do
is sign as the coroner.

- You are disturbingly
good at this.

- I grew up
forging report cards.

If people knew
how smart I was,

it would have been harder
to control them.

- Now all we need
is the death certificate

officially notarized.

- You want me to break
the sacred oath I took

to become a notary?

It's not a problem.
'Cause... I'm a badass.

Just like Rosa.

So...

I am going to stamp this,
and...

violate my oath--

- You can keep talking,
but we're done here.

[thuds]

- Adrian Pimento
is officially deceased.

- Excellent.

All this sneaking around
is exhilarating.

I can feel the adrenaline
coursing through my body.

Coursing.

[gate slams]
- Isabel Cortez,

welcome to your new home.

- This is gonna be fun.
- Really?

What are your weekends like,
Diaz?

- All right.
It's time, Detective.

- Don't forget,
you're seven months pregnant.

Your cervix is ripening
as we speak.

- Mention my cervix again
and I will rip your throat out.

- I don't understand.
You don't like it

when he talks about
your cervix ripening?

Okay, have fun.

- They grow up so fast.

[buzzer sounds]

- Okay, fresh meat.

You're being
transferred here

because you made trouble
in your last prison.

That won't fly here.
Stay in your lane.

- Hey.
You're that cop

who arrested me
three years ago in Brooklyn.

- Uh...

- Amy Santiago,

you're going to prison.

- I don't know.
Is anyone gonna buy it?

I mean,
do I look pregnant?

- I mean...

I guess I can see it.

- I think it's amazing.

Oh, Jake and Amy and baby
makes three.

I don't know
if I believe in God,

but I have
prayed for this.

- That is psychotic.
- [chuckles]

- All right, Ames, let's
go over your cover story again.

- [sighs]
Okay.

My name is Isabel Cortez,
I'm in for murder,

'cause some perv on the subway
tried to touch me

and I was like,

"Did someone order
a tracheotomy?"

- Okay, I think that's
a little too technical.

We need to work on your
tough talk.

So, what are you
in for, Cortez?

- None of your
damn business.

- Nice.
Keep going with that.

- I'm gonna split you
like a sundae with Grandpa...

bitch.

Okay.
Okay.

The "bitch" part was great.
- Yeah.

- Although, mean threats
generally don't involve

having desserts
with your grandparents.

So, just try again.

- Keep telling me what to do
and I'll stab your face off.

- Hell yes!
- Damn!

Like that.

- Okay, now,
here's the plan.

Instead of you
approaching Maura,

we're gonna get her
to come to you.

- Yeah,
try and spread the word

that you've got a connect
on the outside

that gives you access
to contrabands:

cigarettes,
burner phones--

- Pornography.

- Amy, women don't watch--

They do.
- Mm.

- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

Well, that's an exciting
revelation for me.

- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

- Sorry prison
didn't work out.

- Eh, I'll find another use
for that shiv.

- Also, I'm sorry
about Pimento.

I mean,
I know how hard it is

to have a fiancé disappear

because the mob and the FBI
want 'em dead.

I mean...

Actually, I can't
relate at all.

It's the saddest story
I ever heard.

Look, you wanna talk,
I'm a good listener.

- There's nothing
to be sad about.

Pimento's gonna come back,
we're gonna get married

and we're gonna have sex
on Figgis's grave

just like we planned.

- Cool honeymoon.
- Mm-hmm.

- Well, since you're not
in prison, you can help us.

We're gonna throw
a fake funeral

to draw out our FBI guy.
- Good plan.

I always thought
it would be funny

to kill somebody
at a funeral. [laughs]

- Also, you're gonna have to
play the grieving fiancé.

- What?
- So you may not be sad,

but you're gonna
need to look it.

- Fine.

Boo hoo.

- Maybe we'll get you
a real thick veil or something.

- Cellmates!

We have picture and sound.

Amy should be meeting her

I drilled her for hours.
Ew.

I'm sorry, I just realized
what that sounded like.

- It's okay, Jake.
I wish we'd talk like that more.

- No.

- Where you from?

- Passed around the system.

Never stayed anywhere
long enough to call it home.

- Ooh, that's
a good answer.

- Yeah, that one was mine.

I speak the language
of the streets.

It was actually from
"Girl, Interrupted."

- Yeah.

Oh, it's happening.
She dropped the contraband.

Abort.

- People are really starved
for entertainment in here.

- Jail is hell.
- Yeah.

- All that we know about
Figgis's man in the FBI

is that he's a white male
of average height and build,

and according to Jake,
he has a scar on his hand.

- Oh, this is a long-shot,
but if his name is Joe,

could we call him Scar-Joe?

- Scar-Joe.
Never heard that before.

I like it.
We'll use it.

Now, funeral assignments.

Gina and I
will greet people,

shaking hands and checking
for the tell-tale scar.

- Excuse me, sir.

Are you sure you want to be
on the receiving line?

You hate small talk.

- No, I can turn it on
when it's called for.

"The Bachelor"
is a television show, hmm?

Andre Agassi's at it again.

I, too, avoid gluten.

- Okay.

- I want the rest of you
checking out the crowd

for anyone suspicious.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

Am I interrupting?

- No, we just all
came in here separately

you know, breezy stuff.

"The Bachelor"

Andre Agassi's at it again.

How is she?

- Great. She just got lunch,
double helping of spinach.

Baby's gonna love

Wait a minute.
No.

They're Nazis.

The hotties are Nazis.
They're hot-zis.

Swerve, Amy, swerve!

Good, good, good,
good, good, good.

Okay, and...

All right, sitting alone.

Bold choice, bold choice.
- Hmm.

- Oh, here comes Maura.

- Hey, Cortez.

I hear you can smuggle in crap
from outside.

- Noice, it's working.

- That's right, baby.

What do you want?

- What I want...

is for you
to back the hell off...

in this prison.

- Uh-oh.

- Well,
I didn't see your name

on the outside
of the prison,

unless your name is

Texas State Penitentiary
Comma Spring Valley Unit.

- Oh, this is bad.

I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

but she should have sat
with the hot-zis.

[door buzzes]

- Hey, what's going on?

I was talking to Figgis
and then the guard said

I had an appointment.

I'm not supposed to check in
until tomorrow.

People might get suspicious.

- Look, we called you in

because your first contact
with Figgis was a disaster.

- Why? Because our
smuggling plan backfired

and she threatened
to kill me?

- Yes, every single detail
of what you just said.

We need a new plan.
- And I've got one.

I need to step to her.
- Step to her?

Amy, this isn't
"High School Musical."

- Yeah, Amy, this isn't
"High School Musical 2."

- Yeah, and it isn't

"High School Musical 3:
Senior Year."

- All right.

- Point is, it's not
a high school musical.

- That's right.
- I got it.

- Look, Figgis is seriously
dangerous, all right?

She's killed more people
in prison

than she did
on the outside.

- I know,
and if I back down now

she'll never respect me

and we'll get nowhere
with her.

Trust me,
I've got this.

- Okay, I can see
that logic,

but in the interest
of keeping you

as un-shanked as possible,

I think maybe we need a signal
in case things go south.

- Ooh, I know.
Scratch your butt.

- No, that's no good. What if
her butt itches for real?

I've made it through
20 years of adulthood

this time?

You scratched your butt.
Right, Boyle?

- Uh, I don't know.
I was focused on her waddle.

Which you are nailing,

Well, I know for a fact
that I didn't scratch my butt

and I fought through it.

I know what's really
going on here.

You don't think
I'm tough enough to do this.

- Okay, you know what?
Fine, you're right, I don't.

But it's only because Maura

than we anticipated.

I mean, she has a
full back tattoo

of herself stabbing a guy.

- He looks like Tom Hanks!

- Yeah, and that's America's
male sweetheart.

- I can't believe this.

You wouldn't tell Rosa
to stand down.

- Well, yeah,
because she's Rosa.

I mean, one time,
I saw her eat a whole apple

using a knife,
just like in the movies.

- Get over the apple thing.
That was three years ago.
