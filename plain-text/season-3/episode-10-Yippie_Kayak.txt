Come here, come here, come here.

You got to see this.

I'm about to give
Captain Holt his gift.

- Oh, did he lift
his "no gift" policy?

- No, he didn't.

But I figured out a way
to buy him something

and trick him
into accepting it.

- You are bad.
- I know, right?

Oh, wait.
You're making fun of me.

- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I don't care.

He would never open a gift,
right?





     


But what if his gift
didn't look like a gift?

- He would open it?
- Exactly!

I left it in a cardboard box
on his desk.

There's no card,
just the words "Open now,"

which I wrote with my wrong hand

so he wouldn't recognize
my handwriting.

Captain.
- Santiago. Peralta.

- Sir.

So just to recap,

you left an unmarked package
on a police captain's desk

on a random Monday,
with a suspicious message

written on it that looked like

it was scrawled
by a crazy person.

- Mm-hmm.
- Bomb! There's a bomb!

If we're gonna get Gina back,
we need weapons.
