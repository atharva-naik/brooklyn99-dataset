- Peralta, Diaz.

This is
Inspector Knausgaard

Their flight here
was eight hours.

It's been a pleasure
talking with you

about the duration
of your flight.

Good day.

- Well, there goes
my opening question

about how long
your flight was.

- It was eight hours.

- Yeah, no,
I got that.

I was joking, sorry.

It must have got lost
in translation.

- No, we understand
you perfectly.

Everyone in Sweden
speaks English.

- We also speak Norwegian,
Dutch, German,

French, Russian,
and Finnish.

But not Danish.

That is a garbage language
for garbage people.

- Yeah.
- Oh, word up.

Well, I have almost
memorized "Gangnam Style"

phonetically, so samesies.

- I don't know this word.
"Samesies"?

- From context, I believe it
means "proudly uneducated."

- Ah.
- So...

- No.
- Where's our prisoner?

- Being processed.

But, in the meantime,

may I offer you some
of the finest cuisine

in Brooklyn from my
favorite restaurant?

The food cart outside
the precinct.

It's really good.

- Hm, none for Soren.

He's allergic to lactose,
gluten, and tomato ketchup.

- Oh.
- Also, none for Agneta.

She and her husband
are trying

to have another baby,

so she can't

her cervical pH.

- Oh.

- You guys are
real close, huh?

- In Sweden, we believe

partners must be completely open
with each other.

- Yeah.
We have no secrets.

Not even our bodies.

We sauna together
all the time.

- Yeah, well,
we are also very close.

One time, Rosa saw me
in my bathing suit.

- No, I didn't, you told
me to turn around.

- Yeah.
- Well, uh, since we cannot eat

your disgusting street food,

could you please check if our
prisoner has been processed?

- Yeah, we don't mean
to offend, it's just

this place is filthy and you
both seem unprofessional.

- Unprofessional?

Well, we were going
to take you to our favorite

laser tag place, but now,

you're officially uninvited.

Rosa.

- Ah, Boyle. Just the man
we were looking for.

Kevin has accepted
a fellowship to teach

At least how

- Ah, yes.
Farfetched.

- Anyway, Kevin and I belong

to the Park Slope Racquet Club,

Unfortunately, I'll be flying

In any case, I would be honored

so that Raymond

- Absolutely!
I would love to do that!

- Great.
- Formidable.

- Yup!

That is great.
This is great.

This is terrible.
- Why?

You always said you wanted
more face time with Holt.

- No, not like this.

Squash brings out
my competitive side.

breaking racquets, cursing,
excessive mooning.

One time, just to
psych a guy out,

I locked eyes with him
and ate a squash ball.

- That's not possible.

- It's still in me, Terry.

- Look, the point
is to have fun.

So just relax
and have fun.

- Right, right,
right, yeah.

It's just a game.

It's fun.

There's no need
for Holt to see me

unleash the beast.

[laughs]
Okay.

- That's a strange
little man.

- Probably telling Captain Holt
how much they like

to sauna together.
- Please.

They think they're so great
just 'cause

they know
each other's allergies.

You know
what I'm allergic to?

- Yup. Them.
- Totally.

And also bees.
You should know that.

If I got stung by a bee,
I could die.

- Detectives, I've been talking
with the inspectors.

There's been a development
in the Kottbullediamant case.

- Excellent pronunciation,
Captain.

- Tack.
They believe our perp

may have smuggled more

stolen Swedish diamonds
into Brooklyn.

- Oh, well,
thank you for the tip.

Have a wonderful flight home.

We will send you the jewels
as soon as we find them.

- They're staying and
working the case with you.

- Ah, fantastic.

Rosa, could you please fill
my car with a million bees?

- Okay, since the Swedes
are rudely late,

let's talk
anniversary gift.

Should I get Amy something
caszh like shot glasses,

or something less caszh,
like golden shot glasses?

- Still don't care.
How about I get a jump

on our new partners
and search the perp's apartment?

- Right. We'll get some
clues, solve the case,

make them look like fools.

They can eat our
American dust.

- No, no.

Soren is probably
allergic to dust.

Yes, I am allergic

- Everyone is.

That's what sneezes are.

- You're what sneezes are.

- Okay.

Perhaps you don't

You can't work it
without us.

Get your weird,
hairless fingers off of it.

It cuts down on drag.

biggest fanatic.

Just as I am a fanatic
of her slam poetry.

Would you like to hear some?
- Would I like to?

I would hate to!
- Your loss.

Well, we've already searched
the entire apartment.

- Yeah, well,
now we're gonna search it,

and find things you all missed,
like this!

For instance,
here's one that

Hollywood doesn't

A parsec is actually

One of the many inaccuracies

And what's "Star Wars"?

Maybe I'm getting ahead
of myself.

Okay, let's talk planets.

Jupiter is a gas giant.

How does this help me?

a fun mnemonic device

to remember them all.

It goes,

"Every Individual Gets Crayons

"After Telling His Aggressive

"Little Mongoose Painter

"Some Lies About
Tiny Panda Heads--period--

"Maybe One Kid Could Take

Into California, Except--"

Where's Gina?

- She told me you called me
a gas giant.

Well, now you and I
will never hook up.

- Uh-oh.
What's this?

A little piece of evidence
that evaded

your bald little hands.

A shipping manifest
that was shoved

into the back
of a drawer.

- Our perp transferred
a container

to a shipyard in Bay Ridge
on October 11th.

- That arrived
over a month ago,

I doubt you'll find
anything in it.

- Please,
you're just pissed

we cracked the case wide open
and you've got nada.

That's right,
I speak Spanish.

- Actually, we've got
much more than nada.

- Damn it,
he speaks Spanish too.

- Agneta found an invitation
to a party tonight

at the home of...

Alvar Gustavsson.

- The hot blond guy
from "True Blood"?

- No, the Swedish
millionaire

with ties
to organized crime.

Alvar Gustavsson.
- Yeah.

- Oh, that...
Alvar Gooz-hev-vren.

Well, you're welcome to
pursue that dead-end lead

while we got to the shipping
container and find the jewels.

And maybe to celebrate,
Rosa will wear them

to your dumb-ass party.

- No, they're priceless,
please do not do that.

- Yeah, obviously
we wouldn't.

We were just being jerks.

See you later, jerks.

You ready, Boyle?

Psyched up?
- No, why?

Do I seem psyched?

'Cause I'm

"Dingo."

"Etcetera," that would
be one of the names.

for your
six-month anniversary?

Keeping in mind, that he's

- A month ago?

How do I not know

We're not lame

I am so heartbroken,"

"What can I do to help?
I'm sorry,"

and give her a big old hug
and she'd be all

feeling better

to do that

because what we do together

For example...

34G1.

Boom.

We are about to uncover
a butt-load of diamonds.

If you broke up
with your husband,

would you tell Soren
about it?

laugh joke right now?

I would insist
he be there for it

so that my husband would
have a shoulder to cry on.

Agneta and Lars

were having trouble conceiving.

She didn't even have to ask me
to donate my sperm.

I had it already in a
"Tooperware," ready to go.

- Wow, that's...
so gross, yeah.

- Can we ask you
a question?

- Mm-hm.
- Why do you smell like fish?

Is it hygiene?

- No, we spent the night
cutting open

hundreds of dogfish to see
if they had diamonds inside.

- Did they?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

- Yeah. It would be pertinent
to the case.

- They didn't.

Although, one did have
a battery in it.

What kind of a sicko feeds
a battery to a fish?

were wasting your time,

we set up a meeting
on 14 November

with the man we think
is the buyer.

I rescheduled your cycling
practice for 16 November,

and your dentist

But honestly,
I don't know that it's

that bad that they're close.

container came in

10/11, but dumb Europeans

write their dates backwards.

You do realize, that if
we lose this next match,

we're out of the tournament?

- Yes, but the important thing
is we had a good time.

- No! The important thing
is that we win the trophy.

Because I promised Kevin
before he left

for Paris that we would do that.

Do you know why
I chose you as my partner?
