>- Bonjour, mes amis.

 - Oh, someone had a good time in Paris.

 - Oh, Kevin and I shared a perfect week together.

 I feel like I'm floating on a croissant.

 I wonder why people don't just break into song more often.

 - I've been asking you for months if I could

 answer the phone like,

 He's telling Gina to sing.

 Captain Hold is on a vacation high!

 He will say yes to anything right now.

 - I would like a police horse,

 and I'd like Terry to be riding it almost constantly.

- I'd like an HR person
to remind everyone

about workplace boundaries.

- The Japanese make toilet seats

 which squirt a heated jet of water right up your--

 - I'm gonna stop you right there, bud.

 What we need in here is an armored personnel carrier--

 a tank!

 - Two tanks. I want a tank too.

 - Great, so everyone gets a tank.

 Just remember we can't ruin Captain Holt's vacation high,

 so no one say anything that'll upset him.

 Oh, no, what are those morons doing in there?

 - Maybe it's not that bad; maybe they didn't upset him.

 - What'd you do? What'd you say?

 - Nothing. We just said, "Welcome back."

- And laughed with him about all
the weight he gained in France.

 [chuckling] - No!

 - Why is everyone just standing around?

 Get back to work!

 - So long, tank.

 - Tank?

 I gained three pounds in Paris--

 three pounds!

 - Hey, Terry, I have a package for you.

- [grunting]

 - Ooh, Sarge got a present.

 "What's in the box?"

 Brad Pitt, "Se7en."

 But seriously, what's in the box?

- The worst thing in the world.

 [kitten mews] Shut up, stupid.

- Okay, so who sent you a kitten

 and why do you hate it?

- It's not a kitten.

It's a slap in the face

for something that
happened 20 years ago.

 - When you had a flat top?

 I know you had a flat top,

 'cause I saw pictures.

 Sorry, go on with your story, Flat Top Terry.

- It was 1995.

I'd just made detective.

 I was really excited about my first day at the 6-5,

 but the guys in the squad were a bunch of jerks.

 Hi, I'm Terry.

 Which desk is mine?

 - Solve a case,

 then you get a desk.

 - They were like that about a lot of stuff.

 - Whoa, solve a case, then you get coffee.

Solve a case, then you can sign

Debbie's birthday card.

 - Sounds like you needed to solve a case.

- Exactly, so I picked
the biggest one I could find:

a string of B&amp;Es,

all with the same M.O.

Guy climbed in through
high-rise windows.

After a month,
I found my suspect:

Dmitri Kuzkho.

Ex-acrobat with
a criminal record.

 - Circus trash! It has to be him.

- That's exactly what I said.

Circus trash!
It has to be him.

I tracked down my acrobat,

got SWAT to surround
his building.

There was no way anything
could go wrong.

 NYPD! Down!

 Get on the ground!

 - Let's see your hands!

 - Uh-oh.

My guy had a terrible
trapeze fall two years prior--

snapped his spine in half.

 - So why the kitten?

- Well, in the moment,

I may have gotten
a little flustered.

Look, he's got a cat!

 He trained the cat to do the robberies!

 That's why they call them cat burglars!

 Why is no one saying anything?

 [laughter]

 - Oh, Terry.

- Yeah, now they send me cats

to remind me of that day
and rub it in my face.

I'm gonna go put a ad online

so I can find someone to adopt
this evil, little turd.

 - Counterpoint:

you two make an adorable couple.

 Might I suggest putting him in a mug

 and pretending to take a sip?

 Terry, are you stomping off to do my thing?

 - Oh, hey, can I borrow that?

 Genevieve's out of town.

 I need two phones so I can send her

 a "frontie" and a "backie."

- I don't want your ass
in my cloud.

- [sighs]

 [razor buzzing]

Adrian, are you living
in the break room?

 - No, why do you ask?

 - Uh, because you're shaving your shoulder

 in our communal eating space;

 you have a bed set up on the couch;

 stuff like that.

 - Fine. Busted.

 My landlord kicked me out because my stupid neighbors

 couldn't handle a few tiny night screams.

 [shrieking]

 I was dreaming that someone was trying to scalp me

 with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.

- Aren't brains fascinating?

I mean, where does it
come up with this stuff?

 - When I was undercover, someone did try and scalp me

 with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.

- Sure, that would do it.

 - Aren't you dating Rosa?

 Can't you just stay with her?

 - Oh, yeah, no, we're doing this really hot thing

where we haven't told each other where we live.

 Makes our sex play really erotic.

 - Barf. - I totally get that.

Well, you let me know if
there's anything I can do.

 - Oh, yes, I will stay at your home.

 Thank you.

- Me?
What--how now?

 - You just said you wanted to help.

 Oh, unless you weren't being serious,

 which I would get.

 I've been betrayed before.

 For instance, by the grapefruit spoon guy.

- No, no, no, no, definitely.

You could stay with me.

 - Oh! You're the best, Chuck!

 Thank you!

 But for real, get yourself some good ear plugs,

 because I really downplayed how horrible

 those night screams are.

- Ah.

 - All right, I'll see you later, roomie.

- All right.

 - Attention: the 9-9 will be hosting

 a bomb-defusing class tomorrow.

 I highly recommend attending.

 Defusing an explosive device is the ultimate test

 of skill under pressure.

 And the stakes: life or death.

 - Will lunch be provided? - Yes.

- Count us in.

 - Anyone else?

 - I'm in. - Me too.

This class sounds
like "da bomb."

 - I'd rather you didn't attend

 if you're not gonna take it seriously.

 - Yup. - Dismissed.

- I'm gonna dominate that class.

 You don't cross-stitch for 20 years

 without developing a steady hand.

- Wow, you really think
that's a brag, don't you?

20 bucks says I do better
in that class than you do,

thread-head.

 - All right, you're on.

 And I'll have you know that "thread-head"

 is a glowing compliment in the sewing community.

 If you wanted to insult me,

 you should've called me a stitch skipper.

 - Okay, stitch skipper. - Oh, I handed it to you!

 [camera clicks]

 - You better look cute in this picture,

 or no one's gonna want you.

 Do something with your damn paws!

- Whoa, whoa, Sarge, relax.

Look, I think you might be
overreacting a little

to this prank,
and I should know.

You probably won't believe this,
but I was bullied in high school

for being too handsome.

 - I don't believe you. - You're right.

It was for setting my crotch
on fire in shop class.

Hurt like the dickens.

Point is, haters gonna hate.
Shake it off.

Taylor Swift, always right.

 - The reason bullies get to me

 is because I lived with one--

 my dad.

 He was a cruel man who didn't like his life,

 and he took it out on me.

- Okay, okay.

Now we're getting somewhere.

If you're having dad problems,

that's my jam, son.

 - Real weird take on my crappy father.

- You know how I turned
the corner with my dad?

I stood up to him,

and that's what you need
to do with your dad.

 - No, he died in 1988.

- Oh, okay, well, that
probably won't work, then.

But it doesn't mean you can't
go over to the 6-5

and stand up to those bullies.

 - They'll just make fun of me more.

- What are you
talking about, Terry?

You are a human mountain.

You have more muscles
in your ears

than I have in my entire body.

 - Never skip ear day, Jake.

- You can crush metal
with your bare hands.

You can lift a city bus.

You can make your boobies
do that bouncy thing.

 - They're called pecs. - Same thing.

Now, get on over to the 6-5

and make those big jerks
take back that tiny kitten.

 - Yeah. All right.

 I'm doing it.

 [lively music]

 Didn't work.

I have more kittens
than before.

 - What? How?

 - Morning, Sarge.

 Oh, good morning,

 my sweet, little cuties.

- Don't call them cute.

They'd kill us all if
they were smart enough

to use weapons,
but you're not smart.

You're dumb.

You're always naked,
and you pee in a box.

 - I suppose they're not totally naked

 with the fur.

Anyways, you know how you didn't solve that case 20 years ago?

- Thanks for reminding me.

You don't see me bringing up
how you burned your junk off.

 - That didn't happen.

 There was just some light blistering.

 The point is, the only thing those bullies

 have over you is that you never solved that case.

 So why don't we solve it together?

- How are we gonna do that?

 - We'll sneak into the 6-5,

 steal that old case file,

 and work it till we find your burglar.

 Then we march back into that precinct--

- And we grind these kittens up

and shove them
down their throats!

 - Yes!

 [whispering] Don't listen to him.

 You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves.

 - Well, good morning, Linetti.

 Whoo, I slept like a frickin' baby last night.

 Staying at Chuck's is like a dream.

 Little guy loves doting on me,

 although you're gonna need to buy some bigger underwear

 if we're gonna be sharing, you know what I mean?

 - Okay, I'll get right on that.

 - Okay, cool. Here.

 Take care of this for me, will you?

- Yeah.

 - I'm gonna go get some breakfast candy.

 - Okay, catch you later.

 - So things are going really good

 with the new roomie, it seems.

- It's horrible.

There's someone's blood
all over the bathroom.

He sleep-choked me twice.

And the worst part--
this morning,

he ate all of my cereal.

 - That's the worst part?

- They were Nortfluskers
bran circles!

I had them shipped from Oslo.

Oh, I want him out.

But I'm too scared to tell him.

 - All right, listen.

 I know that your spirit animal

 is a caterpillar that's been stepped on--

 - Mm-hmm. - But mine is the mighty wolf.

 And if you want to beat an alpha,

 you have to be an alpha.

- Wrongo.

If you're good enough
at being a beta,

then the alpha
takes mercy on you

and ends up giving you
what you want.

 - Boyle. - Argh!

 - Could you stay out of your kitchen

 for the next, like, 48 hours?

 I'm gonna be skinning a deer than I shot.

- What?

 - Ooh, and put up some of those plastic sheets.

 I have no idea what I'm doing.

 - Okay. - Okay, great.

 Good talk, buddy. - Yup.

The only thing she was
absolutely sure of

to the case,

but did make me feel very good.

 It was 20 years ago.

thinking we could actually solve

 a 20-year-old case with no new leads.

- Terry, we are gonna
solve this, all right?

Sure, maybe none of the work
we did today

led to any new information.

most crimes are solved

within the first 48 hours,

but they never talk
about the crimes

that are solved within
the first 100 million hours.

I said he might
be an accomplice.

You know what?

I hope the guy in there

Let me show you what I did.

I started off by making a map

of all of the burglaries that
have gone down in Brooklyn

since 1996 to see
if there was a pattern.

That led me to this.

There is so much crime
in New York.

No one should live here.

Anyways, I tripped out
on that for a couple hours,

but I got cheered up

after a took a picture
of the kitties

messing around in
my little hoodie.

I'll show it to you later.

 - So basically, you wasted a whole night.

- No, no, no, my friend.

No, no, no, 'cause then
I dove back into your file

and found this.

 - Cool, the low point of my entire life.

was taken in 1996.

You told me your guy
broke his spine

two years before that, so '94.

Check out his sneakers.

'95 Jordans.

after the accident.

Look at the soles.

 Apparently our instructor felt

 we didn't take it seriously enough.

 - But Hitchcock and Scully passed.

- What?

How did they defuse bombs
better than we did?
